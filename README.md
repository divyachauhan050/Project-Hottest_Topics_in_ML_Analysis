# Project - Hottest Topics in Machine Learning Analysis

In this project, I aanalyzed the evolution of some of the most popular topics in Machine Learning by using a dataset of over 50,000 PDF papers that were downloaded and processed from NIPS (Neural Information Processing System) conference.


## About the Datasets

I have used eight different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp) for the analysis. 

## Key Findings
These are some of the key findings for this project:
